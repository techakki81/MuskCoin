   2.1 Install Tailwind Css intellisense
   2.2 test with a h1 in the App.css file 
   Thoughts on Tailwind..
    a) the best practice is already in built 
    b) but do i need to use it just for this? I usually get my design from design dept. 
       its too much to learn again for simple responsive, if you already know css
       even class names are not based on some nomencluare like 
       self-center	actuallly sets align-self: center;
       every property has one entry in Dev tool..too much to go down
